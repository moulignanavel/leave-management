## ✅ Success!

After clicking "Allow", you'll see:
```
✅ Google Calendar connected successfully!
```

Now your approved leaves will automatically sync to Google Calendar! 🎊

---

## 🔒 Is This Safe?

**YES!** This warning appears because:
- Your app is in "Testing" mode (not published)
- Google shows this for ALL unverified apps
- You're the developer, so you can trust your own app
- It's running on your local machine (localhost)

**For production apps**, you'd need Google verification. **For testing/development**, just bypass the warning!
